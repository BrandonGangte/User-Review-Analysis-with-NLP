# User-Review-Analysis-with-NLP
This is my b.tech final year project that analyzes the reviews of a product/events(tweets) using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to get the substantive opinion of the users on the particular product/event.

Links for the datasets used:

1)Electronics products - https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/amazon-reviews-unlocked-mobile-phones

2)Food products - https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
